(0) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Before leaving my office at my college at the end of the day, I push my
work to a remote repository. When I am ready to resume work on a project
at home later in the evening, I pull from that remote repository to my
home computer. At the end of the evening, I push the work from my home
computer back to the remote repository, where I can find it in the morning
at the start of a new day in my office.

(1) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I do not know---automatic pulls sound like a good idea!

(2) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. 
When would you use one instead of another?

I use clone to copy code from a remote repository to my local
computer. My students use clone to copy code that I place on
our local file server or from a repository that they create
on their GitHub accounts by forking a repository in my GitHub
account for their use.

I use fork to copy code from someone else's GitHub account to 
my own GitHub account. My students use fork to copy code that
I place on GitHub for their use.

I use branch on my local machine to create a new version
of a project that I might want to develop in parallel to
other versions.

(3) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known 
state of the remote stored locally?

I do not yet understand.
