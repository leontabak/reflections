When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Before leaving my office at my college at the end of the day, I push my
work to a remote repository. When I am ready to resume work on a project
at home later in the evening, I pull from that remote repository to my
home computer. At the end of the evening, I push the work from my home
computer back to the remote repository, where I can find it in the morning
at the start of a new day in my office.
