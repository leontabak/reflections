(0) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The program creates a hidden folder and files. This creates the
framework that git will use to track the history of changes that
I make to my own files.

(1) How is the staging area different from the working directory and 
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

We indicate to git which changes we would like to record.
Our working directory contains all files, including files for
which we do not want to record a history.
